## 🔧 How It Works

### Architecture Overview
```
User Browser
    ↓
Service Worker (service-worker.js)
    ↓
Push Notification Manager (push-notifications.js)
    ↓
Laravel Backend (PushNotificationService)
    ↓
Scheduler (routes/console.php)
    ↓
Database (users table)
```

### Notification Flow

1. **User Opens App**
   - Service worker registers
   - Browser requests notification permission
   - User clicks "Allow"
   - Subscription sent to server

2. **Scheduler Runs (Every Hour)**
   - Checks all projects for due dates
   - Determines which users need notifications
   - Sends push notifications via PushNotificationService

3. **Notification Delivered**
   - Browser receives push notification
   - Service worker displays notification
   - User sees notification even if app is closed

4. **User Interaction**
   - User clicks notification
   - Browser opens project page
   - Notification marked as read

## 📊 Notification Schedule

### Project Due Notifications
| Days Remaining | Frequency | Time |
|---|---|---|
| 3 days | 2x daily | 9 AM & 6 PM |
| 2 days | 1x daily | 9 AM |
| 1 day | 1x daily | 9 AM |
| 0 days (Today) | 1x daily | 9 AM |
| Overdue | 1x daily | 9 AM |

### Scheduler Runs
- **Every Hour**: Real-time project checks
- **Daily 9 AM**: Morning comprehensive check
- **Daily 6 PM**: Evening reminder check

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Run migration
php artisan migrate

# 2. Start scheduler
