## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Code
```bash
cd d:\Mytime
git add .
git commit -m "Add real-time notifications, new project alerts, hourly due date checks, and enhanced dashboard"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Monitor Render
- Go to Render Dashboard
- Watch deployment logs
- Wait for "Deploy successful"

### Step 3: Configure Environment
- Add mail configuration
- Add application configuration
- Save changes

### Step 4: Set Up Cron Job
- Create cron job service
- Set schedule: `* * * * *`
- Set command: `cd /opt/render/project/src && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`

### Step 5: Run Migrations
- SSH into Render
- Run: `php artisan migrate --force`

### Step 6: Test
- Create new project
- Verify notification in header
- Check email received
- View dashboard
- Check notification page

### Step 7: Monitor
- Check logs regularly
- Verify scheduler running
- Verify emails sending
- Monitor performance

## Success Criteria

✅ Deployment successful when:
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Notifications page accessible
