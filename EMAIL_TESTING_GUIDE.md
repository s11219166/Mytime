# üìß Email Testing Guide - MyTime Application

## Current Configuration

Your email is already configured with Gmail SMTP:

```
Email: chandsalvesh7@gmail.com
SMTP: smtp.gmail.com
Port: 587
Encryption: TLS
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Test Methods

### Method 1: Using Browser (Easiest)

1. **Start your Laravel server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. **Log in to your application**:
   - Go to: `http://localhost:8000/login`
   - Email: `admin@mytime.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

3. **Send a simple test email**:
   - Visit: `http://localhost:8000/test-email`
   - This will send a basic test email to your logged-in user's email

4. **Send a project reminder email** (with beautiful template):
   - Visit: `http://localhost:8000/test-project-email`
   - This will send a formatted project due reminder email

5. **Check your inbox**:
   - Check: `chandsalvesh7@gmail.com`
   - Also check your **Spam/Junk folder** (Gmail might filter it initially)

---

### Method 2: Using Artisan Tinker (Command Line)

1. **Open Artisan Tinker**:
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   ```

2. **Send a simple test email**:
   ```php
   Mail::raw('Test email from MyTime!', function($message) {
       $message->to('chandsalvesh7@gmail.com')
               ->subject('Test Email');
   });
   ```

3. **Press Enter** and check your inbox

4. **Exit Tinker**:
   ```php
   exit
   ```

---

### Method 3: Test Project Due Reminder

1. **Open Artisan Tinker**:
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   ```

2. **Send project reminder email**:
   ```php
   $user = App\Models\User::first();
   $project = App\Models\Project::first();
   
   Mail::to('chandsalvesh7@gmail.com')
       ->send(new App\Mail\ProjectDueReminderMail($project, $user, 3));
   ```

3. **Check your inbox** for the beautiful HTML email

---

### Method 4: Test Automated Notifications

1. **Run the due date checker command**:
   ```bash
   php artisan projects:check-due-dates
   ```

2. This will:
   - Check all projects with due dates
   - Send reminders for projects due in 7, 3, 1 days
   - Send alerts for overdue projects
   - Create in-app notifications

3. **Check your email** for any project reminders

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Email Not Received

**Check Spam Folder:**
- Gmail might filter emails to spam initially
- Mark as "Not Spam" to whitelist

**Check Laravel Logs:**
```bash
# View last 50 lines of log
tail -n 50 storage/logs/laravel.log

# Or on Windows
Get-Content storage/logs/laravel.log -Tail 50
```

**Verify Configuration:**
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

---

### Issue 2: Authentication Failed

**Verify App Password:**
- Make sure you're using Google App Password, not your regular password
- App Password should be 16 characters: `ybqpmvrzvpbpmcfy`
- No spaces in the password

**Create New App Password if needed:**
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification (if not enabled)
3. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Create new app password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password
6. Update `.env` file
7. Run: `php artisan config:clear`

---

### Issue 3: Connection Timeout

**Check Firewall:**
- Ensure port 587 is not blocked
- Try port 465 with SSL instead:
  ```env
  MAIL_PORT=465
  MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl
  ```

**Test Connection:**
```bash
php artisan tinker
```
```php
try {
    Mail::raw('Test', fn($m) => $m->to('chandsalvesh7@gmail.com')->subject('Test'));
    echo "Email sent successfully!";
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
```

---

### Issue 4: "From" Address Issues

**Gmail Requirement:**
- Gmail requires the FROM address to match your Gmail account
- Current setting: `chandsalvesh7@gmail.com` ‚úì Correct

**If you want a custom FROM name:**
```env
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="chandsalvesh7@gmail.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="MyTime Project Management"
```

---

## üìù Notes

   - This is normal for new sending addresses
   - Mark as "Not Spam" to whitelist

2. **Gmail Sending Limits:**

   - More than enough for testing

3. **Production Recommendations:**
   - Use a dedicated email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES)
   - Set up proper SPF/DKIM records
   - Use a custom domain

4. **Security:**
   - Never commit `.env` file to version control
   - Keep your App Password secure
   - Rotate passwords regularly
